  <h2 id="what-is-the-digital-marketplace">What is the Digital Marketplace?</h2>
  <p>
    The Digital Marketplace is a procurement platform that’s making it easier for all digital businesses and government
    to work together. It’s a part of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda">National
    Science and Innovation
    Agenda</a> and being delivered by the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/marketplace/">Digital
    Transformation Agency</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Now in Beta, the Marketplace is about more than bringing a government panel online. We’re building an end-to-end
    digital environment that makes all digital procurement easier — whether it’s straightforward, more complex or
    requiring a higher degree of collaboration and creativity.
  </p>

  <h2 id="who-can-be-a-buyer">Who can be a buyer?</h2>
  <p>
    If you work in government, and you need digital services, you can become a buyer in the Digital Marketplace. Our
    buyers are from across local, state, territory and federal government, including entities such as the ABC, the
    National Museum of Australia and some universities.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have an email address ending in <strong>.gov.au</strong> you can create a buyer account now. If you work in
    government but your email is different, email your account request to <a href="mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au">marketplace@digital.gov.au</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="{{ url_for('main.buyer_signup') }}" role="button">Create a buyer account</a>
  </p>



  <h2 id="why-use-the-digital-marketplace">Why use the Digital Marketplace?</h2>
  <p>As the Digital Marketplace grows, so do the reasons to become a buyer.</p>
  <p><strong>Hundreds of pre-qualified sellers</strong> &mdash; All sellers on the Digital Marketplace Panel (which will
    soon replace the Digital Service Professionals Panel) are appropriately assessed for corporate stability and digital
    expertise before they can apply for an opportunity. You still need to consider if a seller is suitable for your
    needs, and perform any required due diligence.</p>
  <p><strong>New sources of supply </strong>&mdash; In addition to the prequalified Digital Marketplace Panel, the
    Digital Marketplace hosts a directory of sellers who are interested in working with government, but are new to the
    process. They are not panellists but might have just the expertise you&rsquo;re looking for. </p>
  <p><strong>Publish quickly and easily</strong> &mdash; First-time buyers have reported they can <u>create and publish
    a
    brief within 30 minutes</u>. Briefs remain open for either 1 or 2 weeks. So, if what you need is straightforward,
    you
    can have a proposal or resumes on your desk in a little over a week.</p>
  <p><strong>Competitive market prices </strong>&mdash; On average 15 sellers compete for every opportunity, which
    naturally creates a range of options to achieve value for money.</p>
  <p><strong>Support meeting diversity aims </strong>&mdash; Sellers can elect to showcase their Indigenous, disability
    or diversity status through badges that are searchable, which helps buyers policy requirements, for example the
    <a href="https://www.dpmc.gov.au/indigenous-affairs/economic-development/indigenous-procurement-policy-ipp">Indigenous
      Procurement Policy</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Simpler due diligence</strong> &mdash; The Digital Marketplace provides a single source for seller
    insurances and financials that you need in your enhanced due diligence. Insurance documentation will be available
    through the seller profile. Financial documentation will be available on request when you are considering awarding a
    contract.</p>
  <p><strong>Keyword search</strong> &mdash; With hundreds of new sellers onboarding in a richer content environment we&rsquo;ve
    added keyword search on content and badges to help you source the expertise you need.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter legals</strong> &mdash; We&rsquo;ve revised the legal foundation for the Digital
    Marketplace Panel. It&rsquo;s now a modular contract that is designed to scale for procurements from simple to
    complex.</p>



  <h2 id="outcome-or-specialist">Do you need an outcome or specialist?</h2>
  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>
    Agencies are using the Marketplace for a variety of projects large and small. From a <a
      href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=163) }}">short
    assessment of a team’s capabilities</a>, to <a
      href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=155) }}">software
    reviews for next-generation submarines</a> or <a
      href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=93) }}">multi-million
    dollar website projects</a> and everything in between.

  <h2 id="the-buying-process">The procurement process (and why it’s different in the Digital Marketplace)</h2>
  <p>
    Until now, successful procurement involved a lot of pre-research. Before you could go to market you had to carefully
    define your requirements and find a small group of potential sellers who could meet them. The Digital Marketplace
    turns this around. By publishing your opportunity ‘Open to all’ sellers in the Digital Marketplace, it’s easy to
    find sellers who are available and have the expertise you need. And it makes the process easier, instead of going to
    market you simply let the market come to you.
